This directory contains the script used to generate three input data frame files in the directory one above.

The script can be ran, for example, with the following arguments:

    ./createInputFiles.py -p 8 -i /afs/cern.ch/work/a/aelwood/public/alphaT/cmgtools/PHYS14/20150331_SingleMu -o ./

The command will create three files: _tbl_component_met.txt_, _tbl_nevt.txt_, _tbl_xsec.txt_.

This directory also contains a data frame file _tbl_process.txt_. This file was not generated. It was written by hand.
